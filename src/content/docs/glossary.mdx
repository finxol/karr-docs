description: What does it all mean??
---

We might use some strange or unfamiliar word throughout these docs.
Here are their definitions (or at least what we mean by them).

## General

- **Instance**: A deployment of the Karr carpool platform, operated by admins. It is composed of a frontend website, an API, and a database.
- **Admin**: Person/entity who manages an instance.
- **Configuration vs. Settings**: Within Karr, Configuration refers to the technical, lower-level runtime config (API port, auth providers, DB config, etc.);
  Settings refers to higher-level parameters for the application.<br/>
  The former can be configured through the config file or environment variables, and the latter is configured through the web interface (not yet implemented).
