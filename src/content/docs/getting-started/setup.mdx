This guide will walk you through setting up a new instance with Docker.

## Before you start

We will need very few tools for this:

- **Docker**
- An internet connection

That's it.

## Setting up Docker

The compose file we provide is for [Docker Stack](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/stack/),
to be used when [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) is activated.

Please read the docker docs on how to activate swarm mode.

If you do not want to/cannot use Swarm mode, you'll need to adapt the compose file accordingly.

### Set the database password

First off, you'll need to store the Database password in a Docker secret.
It's much more secure to store that way rather than having it directly in the compose file or another file.

Simply run this command to generate a secure password and save it in a `db-password` secret.

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n' | xargs printf '%s' | docker secret create db-password -
```


<Aside>

By doing this, you won't ever see the password for the database.

If you need to have it for any reason, separate the steps:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n'
```

Then pass it on to Docker Secret

```sh
printf "<password>" | docker secret create db-password -
```

When passing it Docker, please make sure to not add a newline (`\n`) character at the end,
so don't use `echo` but rather `printf`!

</Aside>

Please note Docker Secrets cannot be used with regular Docker Compose.

### Configure Karr

For Karr to work properly, it requires a config file with at least the `APP_URL` set (it can be localhost).

See the [configuration reference](/getting-started/configuration-reference) for more details

## Start the instance

Download the stack compose file [from Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finxol/karr/refs/heads/main/compose-stack.yml).
You can change the environment variables to your liking.

Then get the Docker Stack running.

```sh
docker stack deploy -c compose-stack.yml karr
```

**Your very own Karr instance is now running!**
