import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Before you start

## Get the repo

First off, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:finxol/karr.git
```

Make sure to have set up [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
I makes using git much more convenient.

You can also configure git to sign your commits. More info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

## Cards
