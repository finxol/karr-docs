## Before you start

Make sure you've been added to the github repository and have push permission.

The main branch should be protected, so you'll need to work on another branch and
[open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
when your work is ready.

## Get the repo

First off, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:finxol/karr.git
```

Make sure to have [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) set up.
It makes using git much more convenient and [more secure](https://superuser.com/questions/1526712/why-is-ssh-safer-than-https-on-direct-connections-to-a-git-repository-with-crede).

You can also configure git to [sign your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits),
although not compulsory.
