import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Before you start

Make sure you've been added to the github repository and have push permission.

## Get the repo

First off, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:finxol/karr.git
```

Make sure to have [ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) set up.
It makes using git much more convenient and [more secure](https://superuser.com/questions/1526712/why-is-ssh-safer-than-https-on-direct-connections-to-a-git-repository-with-crede).

You can also configure git to sign your commits.
More info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
