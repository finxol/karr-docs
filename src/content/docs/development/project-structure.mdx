description: Understand the architecture of Karr.
---

Karr is a monorepo, meaning it contains multiple packages.

To make it easier and more efficient to manage, we make use of
[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).
This enables parallel builds and caching.

## Existing packages

Each package is defined by its `package.json`.

The root package is `karr`.
It doesn't contain any actual application logic, it's there purely to scaffold and organise the project.

The `apps/` directory contains all the application packages, so what is meant to be shipped and used by clients.
It contains:

- `web`: The Nextjs web frontend
- `api`: The Hono API
- `caddy`: The Caddy reverse proxy to put the pieces together.
- `auth`: An auth package that may or may not disappear in the future

The `packages/` directory contains all packages that are rather meant to be imported elsewhere in the monorepo.
They aren't meant to be distributed or accessed as standalone.
It contains:

- `config`: Imports and deals with runtime Karr configuration
- `db`: Connects to the database
- `settings`:
- `ui`:
- `utils`:
