description: The config package

import { Code, FileTree } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

This package handles all the config imports.

Please refer to the [Configuration Reference](/getting-started/configuration-reference) for a complete overview.


With this configuration file, the directory structure would look like this:

<FileTree>
    - apps
        - api/
        - web/
    - config
        - karr.config.yaml
    - packages
        - config/
        - util/
        - ...
    - ...
</FileTree>

## Exports

The config package has a general export for all config values.
The DB config isn't exported here to avoid leaking credentials.

```ts
import {
    APP_URL,
    API_PORT,
    API_BASE,
    LOG_TIMESTAMP,
    LOG_LEVEL,
    ADMIN_EMAIL,
    AUTH_PROVIDERS,
    FEDERATION,
    FEDERATION_TARGETS,
    APPLICATION_NAME,
    PRODUCTION
} from "@karr/config"; // these are all the config values

console.log(API_PORT);
```

It also has a static export to explicitly import only the hard-coded config values.
These values are defined in `src/static.ts`.

```ts ins="/static"
import { APPLICATION_NAME, API_VERSION } from "@karr/config/static";

console.log(APPLICATION_NAME, API_VERSION);
```

## Files

### `schema.ts`

Defines the entire config schema.

Config file and Full config are separated because some fields are different,
and all fields that are optional in the config file are required in the full exported config.

### `loader.ts`

Handles finding and loading the config from the file or environment.

Pretty-prints the errors encountered in parsing the config (file or env).

### `config.ts`

Exports the config fields to be used throughout.


### `export-schema.ts`

Creates the JSON schema for the config file.

Used with `pnpm run --filter "@karr/config" schema:write`.

### `static.ts`

Contains the static, non-configurable config like `API_VERSION`.
