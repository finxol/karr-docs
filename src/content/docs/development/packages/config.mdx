import yamlConfig from "./config_file.yaml?raw"
import { Code, FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This package handles all the config imports.

Karr can be configured either through environment variables, or with a config file for a more persistent approach.

## Environment variables

Any field from the config file can be set with an envvar.

They follow the same naming as their config file counterpart.
The only exception is the db config, which is prefixed by `DB_`,
e.g. `DB_NAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PASSWORD_FILE`...

## Config file

By default the config file should be located in a `config/` directory at the root of the project and named `karr.config.*`.
These can be overridden by the `CONFIG_DIR` and `CONFIG_FILENAME` environment variables respectively.

The config file can be in `.yaml`, `.yml`, [`.json5`](https://json5.org/) or `.json` format.

You would typically have your local database credentials in this config file.

<Code code={yamlConfig} lang="yaml" title="config/karr.config.yaml" />

With this configuration file, the directory structure would look like this:

<FileTree>
- apps
  - web/
  - api/
- config
  - karr.config.yaml
- packages
  - config/
  - util/
  - ...
- ...
</FileTree>

## Exports

The config package has a general export for all config values.
The DB config isn't exported here to avoid leaking credentials.

```ts
import { API_PORT,
    API_BASE,
    LOG_TIMESTAMP,
    LOG_LEVEL,
    ADMIN_EMAIL,
    API_VERSION,
    APPLICATION_NAME,
    PRODUCTION } from "@karr/config"; // these are all the config values

console.log(API_PORT);
```

It also has a static import to explicitly import only the hard-coded config values.
These values are defined in `src/static.ts`.

```ts ins="/static"
import { APPLICATION_NAME, API_VERSION } from "@karr/config/static";

console.log(APPLICATION_NAME, API_VERSION);
```
