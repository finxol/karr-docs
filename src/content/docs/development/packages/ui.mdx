import { FileTree, LinkCard, Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This package contains all reusable UI components and global style definition.

Most components are made by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
Please [read below](#adding-shadcnui-components).

## Adding shadcn/ui components

**Do not use the CLI**.
The [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) CLI is not made for a monorepo structure, *at least [not yet](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/monorepo)*.
Instead, follow the manual instructions.

<Steps>

1.  **On the page of the component you want to add, go to the Manual tab of the Installation section.**
    ![pnpm run dev](../../../../assets/shadcnui_manual_installation.jpg)

2.  **Copy the code of the component into a new file of the name of the component into `src/components`.**

    For example, a Button component would copied into `packages/ui/src/components/button.tsx`.

3.  **Update the import path for the `cn` utility.**

    By default, it's imported from `"@/lib/utils"`. We want to import it like this instead:

    ```ts
    import { cn } from "@karr/ui/lib/utils"
    ```

    This way the import works both from outside the package because of the `@karr/ui` package specifier,
    and inside the package thanks to the tsconfig path.

4.  If there are any, **install the dependencies into `@karr/ui` directly**, not in `apps/web`.

</Steps>


## Styling

A CSS reset and some base utilities are defined in `styles/`

This CSS hierarchy follows the specifications of [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/).

This pretty much removes the need for breakpoints on certain parts like font sizes.
That is a great thing because there are so many screen sizes nowadays, we can't build specifically for each one.
So building a style system that lets the browser decide, adapts and looks good for all sizes is golden.

##### `globals.css`

Sort of a barrel file to import and place other files in layers.

Also contains the tailwind & shadcn/ui theme configuration.

The layers are `block, utilities, base, theme`, from strongest to lowest precedence.


##### `reset.css`

**Layer**: `base`

Does a few modern CSS resets for more convenience when writing styles.


##### `base.css`

**Layer**: `base`

Defines body styling and basic CSS variables.


##### `utilities.css`

**Layer**: `utilities`

Defines more CSS variables for fluid typing and spacing.

This overrides Tailwindcss' `text-*` classes with fluid sizing.
No need for `text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl`, the font size adjusts automatically to the screen size!


##### `block.css`

**Layer**: `block`

Defines block-scope properties.

For example, all headings get a base style, e.g. for `h1`:
```css
h1 {
    line-height: 1;
    letter-spacing: var(--tracking-s);
    font-weight: bold;
    font-family: var(--font-mono);
    font-size: var(--size-step-5);
    max-width: 20ch;
}
```

These can easily be overridden by specifying a Tailwind class.


## Exports

The UI package has a few exports

##### `@karr/ui/globals.css`

```css

```

##### `@karr/ui/postcss-config`

Exports the `postcss-config.mjs` file.

##### `@karr/ui/lib/*`

Exports any file in the `lib` directory.

```ts
import { cn } from "@karr/ui/lib/utils"
````

##### `@karr/ui/components/*`
