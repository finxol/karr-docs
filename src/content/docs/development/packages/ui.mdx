This package contains all reusable UI components and global style definition.

Most components are made by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).
Please refer to their docs for addition.

**Do not use the cli**, manually copy-paste the component file and install dependencies if needed.
The monorepo setup makes it install components in the wrong place.

## Styling

A CSS reset and some base utilities are defined in `styles/`

This CSS hierarchy follows the specifications of [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/).

This pretty much removes the need for breakpoints.
That is a great thing because there are so many screen sizes nowadays, we can't build specifically for each one.
So building a style system that lets the browser decide, adapts and looks good for all sze is golden.

##### `globals.css`

Sort of a barrel file to import and place other files in layers.

Also contains the tailwind & shadcn/ui theme configuration.

The layers are `block, utilities, base, theme`, from strongest to lowest precedence.


##### `reset.css`

**Layer**: `base`

Does a few modern CSS resets for more convenience when writing styles.


##### `base.css`

**Layer**: `base`

Defines body styling and basic CSS variables.


##### `utilities.css`

**Layer**: `utilities`

Defines more CSS variables for fluid typing and spacing.

This overrides Tailwindcss' `text-*` classes with fluid sizing.
No need for `text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl`, the font size adjusts automatically to the screen size!


##### `block.css`

**Layer**: `block`

Defines block-scope properties.

For example, all headings get a base style, e.g. for `h1`:
```css
h1 {
    line-height: 1;
    letter-spacing: var(--tracking-s);
    font-weight: bold;
    font-family: var(--font-mono);
    font-size: var(--size-step-5);
    max-width: 20ch;
}
```

These can easily be overridden by specifying a Tailwind class.
