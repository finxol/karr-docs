import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This assumes all previous articles are read and understood.

This also assumes you are familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Federation clarification

Although Karr can be a federated service, the frontend does not handle federation.
All federation is done on server side, the client only communicates with its instance's API.

The UI will however show which instance a user/trip comes from.

## Structure

All application code lives in the `src/` directory.

<FileTree>
    - src/
        - app/
            - (index)/ Contains the home page files
                - apage.tsx
            - search/
                - _components/ Local use components
                    - SearchBar.tsx
                    - SearchResults.tsx
                - page.tsx
            - ...
        - assets/ All static assets to be imported
        - components/ Global use components
            - QueryProvider.tsx
        - util/
            - apifetch.ts Helper to fetch data from the API
    - package.json
    - next.config.js
    - ...
</FileTree>

## Conventions/Practices

### Imports

Only imports from the same directory or subdirectories are relative.
Otherwise, use either:

- `@/*`: This alias' root is at `src/`, so `@/i18n/routing` resolves to `src/i18n/routing`.
- `~/*`: This alias' root is at `src/app/`, so `~/auth/actions` resolves to `src/app/auth/actions`.

### Components

Components should live as low in the file tree as possible.

- A component that is useful only in one page should live next to that page,
  or in a `_components` directory next to that page.
- A component that is used across multiple pages should live in the lowest common ancestor's directory,
or its `_components` directory.

Highly reusable components such as buttons, tabs, avatar, stats graph, etc. should be defined in the `@karr/ui` package.
More information on [the package's page](/development/packages/ui).

#### Adding [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components

All shadcn/ui components are small and for targeted uses, so they should be added to the `@karr/ui` package.
Please refer to [this package's documentation](/development/packages/ui).

The only exception is for the pre-build Blocks and Charts *â€” not the Chart component.*
These are bigger pieces of UI that are composed of multiple different components,
so they should be directly put in `apps/web`.
Refer to the [previous section](#components) for details.

### Images

Always use [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image)'s `<Image>`,
importing the image directly into the tsx component when possible, along with `placeholder="blur"` for a nice [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) while the image loads.

### Fetching

Minimise as much as possible any dependence on external providers (Google Fonts, image cdn, etc.).
Always load files and content from API or `assets/`.

#### From the API

##### RPC

The API is built with Hono, which offers [RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc) for end-to-end type safety between the API and web front-end.

The RPC client is ready to use from `@/util/apifetch`.

```ts
import { client } from "@/util/apifetch"
```

Then use it inside a query.
This way, the `data` key will be properly typed with the return type from the API route.

For example:

```ts
const { data, isError, isLoading, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["user"],
    queryFn: async () => {
        const res = await client.user.info.$get()
        if (res.status !== 200) {
            throw new Error("Failed to fetch user data", {
                cause: await res.json()
            })
        }
        return res.json()
    }
})
```

This works the same for other request methods.
The body fields will be properly typed.

For example with post:

```ts
const res = await tryCatch(
    client.trips.add.$post({
        json: {
            ...data
        }
    })
)
if (!res.success) {
    console.error(res.error)
    toast.error("Something went wrong")
} else {
    toast.success(t("added"))
    router.push("/trips/search")
}
```

##### Trips

The trip fetch route gives back an SSE.
This means trips are progressively returned.

This isn't yet supported by Hono RPC, so use:
```ts
import { apiFetch } from "@/util/apifetch"
```

#### External

You shouldn't need to fetch from external urls, but if you do, use [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch).
```ts
import { ofetch } from "ofetch"
```
