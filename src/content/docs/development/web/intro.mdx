import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This assumes steps in [Getting started](/development/getting-started)
and [Project structure](/development/project-structure) are done and understood.

This also assumes you are familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Structure

All application code lives in the `src/` directory.

<FileTree>
    - src/
        - app/
            - (index)/ Contains the home page files
                - apage.tsx
            - search/
                - _components/ Local use components
                    - SearchBar.tsx
                    - SearchResults.tsx
                - page.tsx
            - ...
        - assets/ All static assets to be imported
        - components/ Global use components
            - QueryProvider.tsx
        - util/
            - apifetch.ts Helper to fetch data from the API
    - package.json
    - next.config.js
    - ...
</FileTree>

## Conventions/Practices

### Imports

Only imports from the same directory are relative, otherwise, all are `@/*`.
This alias' root is at `src/`, so `@/components/QueryProvider` resolves to `src/components/QueryProvider`.

### Components

Components that are meant to be used within only one scope should be defined in a local `_components/` directory.

Components that are meant to be used in multiples pages should be defined in the root `components/` directory.
To avoid a huge component dump, they can be sorted by use.

UI components such as buttons, tabs, avatar, stats graph, etc. should be defined in the `@karr/ui`.
More information on [the package's page](/development/packages/ui).

### Images

Always use [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image)'s `<Image>`,
importing the image directly into the tsx component.
When possible, also use `placeholder="blur"` for a nice [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) while the image loads.

### Fetching

Minimise as much as possible any dependence on external providers (Google Fonts, image cdn, etc.).
Always load files and content from API or `assets/`.

#### From the API

To fetch data from the API, use `@/util/apifetch`.
This predefines the behaviour and API base route for data fetching.

#### External

You shouldn't need to fetch from external urls, but if you do, use [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch).
```ts
import { ofetch } from "ofetch"
```
