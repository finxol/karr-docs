import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This assumes steps in [Getting started](/development/getting-started)
and [Project structure](/development/project-structure) are done and understood.

This also assumes you are familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Federation precision

Although Karr is a federated service, the frontend does not handle federation.
All federation is done on server side, the client only communicates with its instance's API.

However, the UI will show which instance a user/trip comes from.

## Structure

All application code lives in the `src/` directory.

<FileTree>
    - src/
        - app/
            - (index)/ Contains the home page files
                - apage.tsx
            - search/
                - _components/ Local use components
                    - SearchBar.tsx
                    - SearchResults.tsx
                - page.tsx
            - ...
        - assets/ All static assets to be imported
        - components/ Global use components
            - QueryProvider.tsx
        - util/
            - apifetch.ts Helper to fetch data from the API
    - package.json
    - next.config.js
    - ...
</FileTree>

## Conventions/Practices

### Imports

Only imports from the same directory are relative, otherwise, all are `@/*`.
This alias' root is at `src/`, so `@/components/QueryProvider` resolves to `src/components/QueryProvider`.

### Components

Components that are meant to be used within only one scope should be defined in a local `_components/` directory.

Components that are meant to be used in multiples pages should be defined in the root `components/` directory.
To avoid a huge component dump, they can be sorted by use.

UI components such as buttons, tabs, avatar, stats graph, etc. should be defined in the `@karr/ui`.
More information on [the package's page](/development/packages/ui).

#### Adding [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components

All shadcn/ui components are small and for targeted uses, so they should be added to the `@karr/ui` package.
Please refer to [this package's documentation](/development/packages/ui).

The only exception is for the pre-build Blocks and Charts *â€” not the Chart component.*
These are bigger pieces of UI that are composed of multiple different components,
so they should be directly put in `apps/web`.
Refer to the [previous section](#components) for details.

### Images

Always use [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image)'s `<Image>`,
importing the image directly into the tsx component.
When possible, also use `placeholder="blur"` for a nice [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh/) while the image loads.

### Fetching

Minimise as much as possible any dependence on external providers (Google Fonts, image cdn, etc.).
Always load files and content from API or `assets/`.

#### From the API

To fetch data from the API, use `@/util/apifetch`.
This predefines the behaviour and API base route for data fetching.

##### Trips

The trip fetch route gives back an SSE.
This means trips are progressively returned.

The web frontend needs to use [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource).

Although won't work for the moment, the API check auth with Authorization header, which is not supported by SSE/EventSource.
Need to remove auth check on this route at least until mock login is built, then use cookies instead.

<summary>Working example in Svelte</summary>

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import { onMount } from "svelte";

    let dataItems: Array<Record<string, any>> = [];
    let eventSource: EventSource | null = null;

    let loading = true;

    onMount(() => {
        eventSource = new EventSource("http://localhost:3000/v1/trip/search");

        // Listen for the custom "new-trips" event
        eventSource.addEventListener("new-trip", (event) => {
            const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
            dataItems = [...dataItems, data];
            console.log("New data received:", data);
            console.log("All data:", dataItems);
        });

        eventSource.onerror = (error) => {
            if (eventSource?.readyState === 0) {
                console.warn("SSE connection closed by the server.");
                eventSource.close();
                loading = false;
            } else {
                console.error("EventSource failed:", error);
            }
        };

        return () => {
            // Cleanup when the component is destroyed
            eventSource?.close();
        };
    });
</script>

<p>
    PoC won't work anymore, auth has been added to the API through Authorization
    header for the moment. Will move to cookie auth in the future to support
    EventSource.
</p>

{#if dataItems.length === 0}
    <p>No data received yet.</p>
{/if}

<div>
    {#each dataItems.sort((a, b) => parseInt(a.id) - parseInt(b.id)) as item}
        <div>{JSON.stringify(item)}</div>
    {/each}
    {#if loading}
        <p>Loading...</p>
    {/if}
</div>
```
</details>

#### External

You shouldn't need to fetch from external urls, but if you do, use [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch).
```ts
import { ofetch } from "ofetch"
```
