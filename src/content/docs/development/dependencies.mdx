Karr is built on Node with pnpm.
Pnpm offers a feature called [catalogs](https://pnpm.io/catalogs).
This feature enables dependency consistency within the monorepo,
and lets us [categorise our dependencies](https://antfu.me/posts/categorize-deps).

## Catalogs

At the root of the monorepo, there is a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file.
Among other things, this file contains all catalogs.

The current list of catalogs is made to sort the dependencies neatly by use.

## Tooling

Since the catalogs feature in pnpm is still relatively recent, tooling support isn't great _yet_,
even inside pnpm itself.
To bridge that gap, there are a couple of neat little tools to make life easier.

### `nip`

[Nip](https://github.com/antfu/nip) enables us to install dependencies directly inside a catalog.

Instead of finding a dependency version and adding it ourslves in the appropriate catalog,
or installing it directly inside a package then moving it manually to a catalog,
we can simply pass it to `nip` and it will do the work for us.

#### Usage

Instead of running `pnpm install package-name`, run:

```bash
pnpm nip package-name
```

Follow the promps to choose the appropriate catalog, and your dependency will be added neatly!

### `taze`

**You probably won't need to use this one yourself.**

Taze is a tool that makes updating all dependencies in a workspace much easier.

This is run periodically via Github Actions to automate the upgrade process.

#### Usage

Simply run `pnpm taze` to update everything inside `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
