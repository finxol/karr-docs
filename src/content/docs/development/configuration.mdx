## Karr configuration

The default configuration for Karr isn't necessarily what will work for your local environment.
You can easily change the config to use through a config file or environment variables.

Please refer to the [Configuration Reference](/getting-started/configuration-reference) for a complete overview.

More info on Karr configuration in the [@karr/config page](/development/packages/config/).

### Database

Karr needs access to a PostgreSQL database.

The database name can be configured in the config file, but it needs to exist before connecting to it.
Running the Docker Postgres container with the `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable automatically creates the database.

The database migrations are applied automatically on API start.
